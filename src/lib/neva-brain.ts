- Premium does not mean more effects. Use restraint, clarity, and taste before adding glow, particles, smoke, flares, heavy bloom, or neon.
- Every visual needs one clear focal point, strong visual hierarchy, readable silhouettes, controlled contrast, and intentional negative space.
- FiveM quality should feel like polished GTA V / Rockstar Editor promotional work: game-authentic, cinematic, grounded, not generic real-life stock photography.
- Prefer motivated light sources: sunset, street lamps, office windows, garage lights, vehicle headlights, police practicals. Avoid random colored lighting unless requested.
- Color grading must be controlled: deep but readable shadows, warm or neutral highlights, no crushed faces, no oversaturated skin, no plastic HDR.
- Marketing polish means composition, readability, identity, and conversion impact first; effects are only accents.
- If a character is uploaded, identity preservation beats style: face, tattoos, accessories, body proportions, outfit silhouette, and recognizable details stay stable.`;
